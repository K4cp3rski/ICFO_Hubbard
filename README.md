# ICFO_Hubbard

This is a repository containing code I wrote under the supervision of dr Marcin Płodzień during my research stay at the Quantum Optics Theory group at Institut de Ciencias Fotònicas (ICFO) in August of 2022.

The following repository contains code for Exact Diagonalization, following the paper by [Zgang and Dong](http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4006) for spinful and spinless Fermi- and Bose-Hubbard models. 

The code was also used for the reproduction of Fig. 2 from [Le et al. *Topological phases of a dimerized Fermi–Hubbard model for semiconductor nano-lattices*, npj Quantum Inf 6(1), 24 (2020)](http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-0253-9)
